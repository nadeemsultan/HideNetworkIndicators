[![Get it on Google Play](https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_60.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nadeemsultan.hidenetworkindicators)

A small Xposed module that brings back the original AOSP look on custom roms by hiding the network activity indicators.

This app requires the [Xposed Framework](http://repo.xposed.info/) and has no effect without it.

###Changelog
* **1.3** : Updated for Lollipop
* **1.2** : New method of hiding indicators, should now have better compatibility on pre-4.4 roms
* **1.1** : Hide Mobile Data Indicators
* **1.0** : Initial Release
